## Description:

This is end of Phase 2 Project assignment as required by Moringa School. For this project, we will design and code a book recommedation app using React.js. The App will run on a single html file, but will styled using CSS and add interactivity with Javascript.

This project will include the following components:

1. Search Component so that users can enter the title or author's name in the search bar to quickly find specific books you're interested in.

2. Favorites Component where users can quickly find and access their preferred books without the need to search or browse through the entire catalog repeatedly.

3. Book Library component to allow users browse through a vast collection of books, organized by various categories such as bestsellers, authors , etc.

4. About Book Component that will provide detailed information such as title, author, publication date, description, reviews, ratings, and other relevant metadata. This component will also display Review Form Component for readers to provide detailed feedback, share their impressions, and highlight the aspects they enjoyed or found lacking in the book.

5. Finally, the project will include Header and Footer Components to display navigation and copyright information respectively.

## The website will be hosted on GitHub. LINK

## What problem does the website solve?

The existing book market lacks efficient and personalized methods for readers to discover new books that align with their specific interests and preferences. This leads to a significant challenge in finding relevant and engaging reading material, resulting in decreased reading enjoyment and limited exposure to diverse literary genres. 

Therefore, there is a need for a book recommendation website that leverages user preferences and advanced algorithms to deliver tailored reading recommendations, enhancing the overall reading experience and promoting literary exploration.

## Project Setup
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Deliverables/Project Requirements:

1. A well documented Readme file on Github A project README that includes: - project or program name - author name - description of project - project setup instructions - link to live site on GitHub Pages - copyright and license information

2. Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
Suggestions for what this can mean: Intuitive, easy to follow layout. Simple yet polished styling. Form field labels where appropriate. Form fields that are validated correctly, and get cleared after submitting. Detailed, well put together readme. No typos. And much more.

3. Project works as expected All objectives are functionally met in the deployed project.

4. 20 + commits in the project with well detailed commit messages

5. App uses at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized

6. This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeThe app has at least 3 client-side routes using react-router

7. This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeThe app uses a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server.

8. Project follows good coding practices by keeping code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.
